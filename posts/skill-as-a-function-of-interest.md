I've long grappled with the idea that some people are inherently better or worse at certain skills than others. [Some people believe it](https://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-become-a-better-programmer-by-not-programming/), but it _feels_ wrong. I want to believe that everyone is equal, but that doesn't seem to be true. For example, I had a much easier time picking up programming than any sort of social or musical talent. For others, the experience has been the opposite.

Lately, I've come to a different conclusion. I wasn't born a programmer any more than I was, for example, a musician. **The key difference was that I continued to write code enthusiastically even** [**when I wasn't any good**](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/PullJosh/projects/?page=last)**.** Even the simplest progress was exciting for me, which wasn't true of other skills. That excitement fueled me to continue practicing programming even when it was hard.

**I believe that skill is a direct function of practice, and engaged practice is a direct function of interest.** _If,_ in an alternate universe, I had spent 5,000 hours practicing music (like I have with programming), I would probably be pretty good. But I _can't_ practice that much because I don't have the interest to sustain it.

In a way, this is the most beautiful insight of all. The only challenges you can't overcome are the ones you don't _want_ to overcome. I take comfort in that.
