A few years ago I discovered something strange: "Mental image" is a far more literal phrase than I had ever believed. **It turns out that the majority of people really can "see" things that aren't in front of them. I cannot.** [It's a condition known as Aphantasia](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-the-minds-eye-is-blind1/), and — although little is known about it — there are [many people](https://www.reddit.com/r/aphantasia) who have recently come to the same discovery.

Fortunately, people with Aphantasia seem to be faring pretty well. Ed Catmull, for example, was president of Pixar despite [having Aphantasia](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47830256). In fact, I would argue that limitations like Aphantasia can be beneficial in certain fields.

# Imagine this...

Imagine, if you can, blindness of the eyeballs, not just the mind. A blind person must, necessarily, become a talented sightless navigator. Years of practice accumulate until a blind person can navigate nearly as well as a sighted one. They'll never be quite as quick at getting around, of course, but they can come pretty close.

But if you took a blind person and a sighted person and put them both in blindfolds, the tables would turn. The blind person — with years of practice — would be able to navigate quite well. But the usually-sighted person would struggle with even the most basic skills.

# What Does it Mean for Me?

Aphantasia, I believe, is similar to the blindfold analogy. In the general case, I (and other aphants) will underperform in mental tasks. My reading comprehension of fiction, for example, is atrocious. But in certain cases *everyone's* mind is blinded, and my intense practice helps me in those areas.

I believe programming is one such occasion. **Programming, as far as I can discern, is not a skill which is particularly aided by visual imagery.** Almost everyone who is writing code needs to think in data, which can be a challenge for many. **As a person with Aphantasia, I — like the blind in a blindfold — feel no less comfortable writing code than I do thinking about anything else.**

The general principle, it seems, is that challenges and limitations can result in surprising benefits. I, for one, will be capitalizing on the good parts.
