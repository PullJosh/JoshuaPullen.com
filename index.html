          <h3 class="project__title">Rocket Spelling</h3>
          <p>Rocket Spelling is a website designed to help elementary school students learn to spell.</p>
          <p>This project was my first full stack website (I had previously been working entirely on the front end). If I were to do it again, there are a lot of decisions I would make differently, but I'm still proud to have made the site at all.</p>
          <p>Thousands of students use Rocket Spelling every year, which is an incredible blessing. I love it when my work provides real value.</p>

          <h3 class="project__title">Scratch Camp</h3>
          <p>In the summers 2016 and 2017 I taught local elementary school students the basics of programming with <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scratch</a> in a week-long "Scratch Camp".</p>
          <p>Turnout was excellent, with over 100 students in 2017 (which required splitting up into many hours and even adding additional web development camps taught by a local schoolteacher).</p>

          <p>I created the updated Online Math League website as a summer project. Unlike Rocket Spelling, I don't run the math league, but I do love its mission.</p>
          <p>The Online Math League website is the first project I made using Node.js. Again, there are things I would do differently given a second chance, but I learned a lot throughout the process.</p>

          <p>Third Grade Math Games is a small collection of math games designed for an elementary school (3rd grade) audience.</p>
          <p>This is one of the first websites I ever made. All of the games were originally shared on my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/PullJosh/">Scratch profile</a>. The website was created later as a central location for all of them.</p>
